about=Manage and analyse networks of different geospatial formats using GNM (Geographical Network Model) which is a part of GDAL library. Currently only ESRI Shapefile format is supported for building networks. You can create connectivity over a set of Shapefiles and after that do Dijkstra shortest path search, K-shortest paths search or Connected components search. Also you are able to block features and see the changes in results of such analysis. Important: the plugin requires that QGIS is built with GDAL 2.1 (or later) in which GNM is turned on.
